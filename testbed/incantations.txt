- Run tests in testbed/ folder

# Run Interactive Session

# Run HIL Tests
slash run tests/<path_to_test> --testbed <TestbedName>

# e.g: Run VehicleHIL test
slash run tests/test_setup.py --testbed VehicleHIL

# You can bulk tests together in test suites <text files>
slash run -f <path_to_bulk_tests>.txt

where <path_to_bulk_tests>.txt looks like this:

How to run tests
----------------
Setup slcan:
"sudo -dmesg -w" // which dev port to use, its usually ttyACMXX where XX is a number
"sudo slcand -l -s6 -S 230400 /dev/ttyACMXX"
"sudo ip link set up slcan0"

There is a python script called setup_can.py that automatically sets up the slcan0 bus.
Execute it like this:
"sudo su" in firmware/testbed folder // need to be super user to Execute
"python setup_can.py"

Run a test:
"sudo su" in firmware/testbed
"whereis slash" // I can't remember where it is currently located (TODO make this part of path)
"path/to/slash run tests/test_can.py --testbed VehicleHIL"
