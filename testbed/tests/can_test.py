### TEMPORARY
# How to check for DTC example (where 10 = a DTC code, vcu = teststand.vehicle_boards["vcu"])
# vcu.dtc_logger.has_dtc(10) 
# --> returns a bool for if it has a dtc
# vcu.dtc_logger.get_dtc_data(10) 
# --> returns an array of DTC data where the length is the number of times the dtc was received
#     (also marks the dtc as read, so the second time you call it you'll get an empty array
#       unless you received another dtc of the same code)
# vcu.dtc_logger.get_dtc_structs(10)
# --> same as before but returns the actual DTC class objects instead of just the data
# vcu.dtc_logger.list_dtcs() 
# --> returns a list of all the dtc codes that have been received
# vcu.dtc_logger.reset_logger()
# --> resetst the logger to {}
